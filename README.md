# EthanOS 🌟
Showcasing my journey into coding, AI, and problem solving (e.g., Systemic opression, or What to eat today?)
Welcome to **EthanOS**! This repository showcases my journey into coding, artificial intelligence, and problem-solving.  
## 🎯 Mission  
To learn, grow, and apply technology in meaningful ways—whether it’s tackling systemic oppression 🌍 or figuring out what to eat today 🍕.

## 📂 What’s Inside  
- **💻 Early Projects:** My first steps into Python, GitHub, and AI.  
- **🚀 Big Goals:** Exploring solutions to real-world challenges using technology.  
- **🎉 Small Wins:** Celebrating the little victories, like mastering loops 🔄 or debugging that one error 🐛.  

## 🤔 Why EthanOS?  
This is more than just a repository; it’s my personal operating system 🛠️ for learning and creating. Each project, no matter how small, is a building block for something bigger.  

Let’s build something amazing, one line of code at a time. ✨
